Known Problems
==============

Right know, the unique problem I found is with the generated signature's output
and with the block size. That's: For small files you should use a small block
size and signature's size, for medium size files the defaults are OK and, for 
"somewhat" big files (more than 32MB) you should change the signature's output 
size to a bigger value (in example, 64 bits).

It's planned to do, in the future, the calculation automatically but, as it's 
more flexible as is, I need to think about...
